# CoverLetterGenius
CoverLetterGenius is an innovative web application that leverages the power of the OpenAI GPT API to generate 
personalized and impactful cover letters. This project was initially intended to be a startup,
but due to market saturation, I have decided to make it a public repo to showcase my skills and abilities. 
I have passionately worked on this project from January to March during evenings and weekends, and while it is not complete,
it demonstrates my capabilities as a developer. Please note that due to the unintentional push of some critical data,
a new repository was created to avoid data leakage.

# Technologies
Django: Web framework for building the application
Bootstrap 5, HTML, Javascript: Responsive front-end framework
AWS Cognito: User authentication and management
AWS RDS: Managed relational database service
